.# Abstract

This document introduces an in-band method for DNS operators to
publish arbitrary information about the zones they are authoritative
for, in an authenticated fashion and on a per-zone basis.
The mechanism allows managed DNS operators to securely announce
DNSSEC key parameters for zones under their management, including for
zones that are not currently securely delegated.

Whenever DS records are absent for a zone's delegation, this signal
enables the parent's registry or registrar to cryptographically
validate the CDS/CDNSKEY records found at the child's apex.
The parent can then provision DS records for the delegation without
resorting to out-of-band validation or weaker types of cross-checks
such as "Accept after Delay".

This document deprecates the DS enrollment methods described in Section
3 of RFC 8078 in favor of (#dnssec-bootstrapping) of this document.

# Introduction

Securing a DNS delegation for the first time requires that the
Child's DNSSEC parameters be conveyed to the Parent through some
trusted channel.
While the communication conceptually has to occur between the Parent
registry and the DNSSEC key holder, what exactly that means and how
the communication is coordinated traditionally depends on the
relationship the Child has with the Parent.

A typical situation is that the key is held by the Child DNS
Operator; the communication thus often involes this entity.
In addition, depending on the circumstances, it may also involve the
Registrar, possibly via the Registrant (for details, see [@!RFC7344],
Appendix A).

As observed in [@!RFC7344], these dependencies often result in a manual
process that is susceptible to mistakes and/or errors.
In addition, due to the annoyance factor of the process, involved
parties may avoid the process of getting a DS record set published in
the first place.

To alleviate these problems, automated provisioning of DS records has
been specified in ([@!RFC8078]).
It is based on the Parental Agent (registry or registrar) fetching
DNSSEC key parameters from the CDS and CDNSKEY records ([@!RFC7344])
located at the Child zone's apex, and validating them somehow.
This validation can be done using the Child's existing DNSSEC chain of
trust if the objective is to update an existing DS record set (such as
during key rollover).
However, when bootstrapping a DNSSEC delegation, the Child zone has
no existing DNSSEC validation path, and other means to ensure the
CDS/CDNSKEY records' legitimacy must be found.

For lack of a comprehensive DNS-innate solution, either out-of-band
methods have been used so far to complete the chain of trust, or
cryptographic validation has been entirely dispensed with, in
exchange for weaker types of cross-checks such as "Accept after
Delay" ([@!RFC8078] Section 3.3).
[@!RFC8078] does not define an in-band validation method for enabling
DNSSEC.

This document aims to close this gap by introducing an in-band method
for DNS Operators to publish arbitrary information about the zones
they are authoritative for, in an authenticated manner and on a
per-zone basis.
The mechanism allows managed DNS Operators to securely announce
DNSSEC key parameters for zones under their management.
The Parent can then use this signal to cryptographically validate the
CDS/CDNSKEY records found at an insecure Child zone's apex, and upon
success secure the delegation.

While applicable to the vast majority of domains, the protocol does
not support certain edge cases, such as excessively long Child zone
names, or DNSSEC bootstrapping for domains with in-bailick nameservers
only (see (#limitations)).

DNSSEC bootstrapping is just one application of the generic signaling
mechanism specified in this document.
Other applications might arise in the future, such as publication of
API endpoints for third-party interaction with the DNS Operator or of
other operational metadata which the DNS Operator likes to publish.

Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [@!RFC4033],
[@!RFC4034], [@!RFC4035], [@RFC6781], [@!RFC7344], and [@!RFC8078].


## Terminology

This section defines the terminology used in this document.

CDS/CDNSKEY
: This notation refers to CDS and/or CDNSKEY, i.e., one or both.

Child
: see [@!RFC8499] Section 7

Child DNS Operator
: The entity that maintains and publishes the zone information for
  the Child DNS.

Parent
: see [@!RFC8499] Section 7

  Parent zone on behalf of the Child.
  (It could be the registry, registrar, a reseller, or some other
  authorized entity.)

Signaling Domain
: A hostname from the Child's NS record set, prefixed with the label
  `_signal`.
  There are as many Signaling Domains as there are distinct NS

{#signaling}
# Signaling

This section describes the general mechanism by which a Child DNS
Operator can publish an authenticated signal about a Child zone.
Parental Agents (or any other party) can then discover and process the
signal.
Authenticity is ensured through standard DNSSEC validation.


## Chain of Trust

If a Child DNS Operator implements the protocol, each Signaling Zone
MUST be signed and be validatable by the Parental Agent (i.e. have a
valid DNSSEC chain of trust).
This is typically achieved by securely delegating each Signaling Zone.

For example, when publishing a signal that relates to a Child zone
with NS records `ns1.example.net` and `ns2.example.org`, the Child
DNS Operator needs to ensure that the Parental Agent has a valid DNSSEC
chain of trust for the zone(s) that are authoritative for the Signaling
Domains `_signal.ns1.example.net` and `_signal.ns2.example.org`.


{#signalingnames}
## Signaling Names

To publish a piece of information about the Child zone in an
authenticated fashion, the Child DNS Operator MUST publish one or
more Signaling Records at a Signaling Name under each Signaling Domain.

Signaling Records MUST be accompanied by RRSIG records created with
the corresponding Signaling Zone's key(s).
The type and contents of these Signaling Records depend on the type of
signal.

The Signaling Name identifies the Child and the Signaling Type.
It is identical to the Child name (with the final root label removed),
prefixed with a label containing the Signaling Type.

{#dnssec-bootstrapping}
# Bootstrapping a DNSSEC Delegation

When the Child zone's CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets are used for setting up initial
trust, they need to be authenticated.
This is achieved by co-publishing the Child's CDS/CDNSKEY records as an
authenticated signal as described in (#signaling).
The Parent can discover and validate it, thus transferring trust from
the Child DNS Operator nameservers' chain of trust to the Child zone.

The DS enrollment methods described in Section 3 of [@!RFC8078] are
deprecated and SHOULD NOT be used.
Child DNS Operators and Parental Agents who wish to use CDS/CDNSKEY
records for initial DS enrollment SHOULD instead support the
authentication protocol described in this section.

This protocol is not intended for updating an existing DS RRset.
For this purpose, the Parental Agent can validate the Child's
CDS/CDNSKEY records directly, using the chain of trust established by
the existing DS RRset ([@!RFC7344] Section 4).


{#signalingrecords}
## Signaling Consent to Act as the Child's Signer

To confirm its willingness to act as the Child's delegated signer and
authenticate the Child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets, the Child DNS Operator
MUST co-publish them at the corresponding Signaling Name under each
out-of-bailiwick Signaling Domain ((#signalingnames)).
For simplicity, the Child DNS Operator MAY also co-publish the Child's
CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets under Signaling Domains that are in bailiwick,
although those Signaling Domains are not used for validation
((#cds-auth)).

Unlike the CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child's apex, Signaling
Records MUST be signed with the corresponding Signaling Zone's
key(s).  Their contents MUST be identical to the corresponding
records published at the Child's apex.

Existing use of CDS/CDNSKEY records is specified at the Child apex
only ([@!RFC7344], Section 4.1).  This protocol extends the use of
these record types to non-apex owner names for the purpose of DNSSEC
bootstrapping.  To exclude the possibility of semantic collision,
there MUST NOT be a zone cut at a Signaling Name.

### Example

For the purposes of bootstrapping the Child zone `example.co.uk` with NS
records `ns1.example.net`, `ns2.example.org`, and `ns3.example.co.uk`,
the required Signaling Domains are `_signal.ns1.example.net` and
`_signal.ns2.example.org`.

In the zones containing these domains, the Child DNS Operator
authenticates the CDS/CDNSKEY records found at the Child's apex by
co-publishing them at the names:
```
_dsboot.example.co.uk._signal.ns1.example.net
_dsboot.example.co.uk._signal.ns2.example.org
```
The records are accompanied by RRSIG records created using the key(s)
of the respective Signaling Zone.

Publication of Signaling Records under the in-bailiwick domain
`_signal.ns3.example.co.uk` is not required.

{#cds-auth}
## Validating CDS/CDNSKEY Records for DNSSEC Bootstrapping

To validate a Child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRset for DNSSEC bootstrapping, the
Parental Agent, knowing both the Child zone name and its NS
hostnames, MUST execute the following steps:

1. verify that the Child is not currently securely delegated and that at
   least one of its nameservers is out of bailiwick;

2. query the CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child zone apex directly from
   each of the authoritative servers as determined by the delegation's
   NS record set (without caching);

3. query the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at the Signaling Name under
   each out-of-bailiwick Signaling Domain using a trusted DNS resolver
   and enforce DNSSEC validation;

4. check (separately by record type) that all record sets retrieved
   in Steps 2 and 3 have equal contents;

If the above steps succeed without error, the CDS/CDNSKEY records are
successfully validated, and the Parental Agent can proceed with the
publication of the DS record set under the precautions described in
[@!RFC8078], Section 5.

If, however, an error condition occurs, in particular:

- in Step 1: the Child is already securely delegated or has in-bailiwick
  nameservers only;

- in Step 2: any failure during the retrieval of the CDS/CDNSKEY
  records located at the Child apex from any of the authoritative
  nameservers;

- in Step 3: any failure to retrieve the CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets located
  at the Signaling Name under any Signaling Domain, including failure
  of DNSSEC validation, or unauthenticated data (AD bit not set);

- in Step 4: inconsistent responses (for at least one of the types),
  including a record set that is empty in one of Steps 2 or 3, but
  non-empty in the other;

the Parental Agent MUST abort the procedure.

### Example

To verify the CDS/CDNSKEY records for the Child `example.co.uk`, the
Parental Agent (assuming that the Child delegation's NS records are
`ns1.example.net`, `ns2.example.org`, and `ns3.example.co.uk`)

1. checks that the Child domain is not yet securely delegated;

2. queries CDS/CDNSKEY records for `example.co.uk` directly from
   `ns1.example.net`, `ns2.example.org`, and `ns3.example.co.uk`
   (without caching);

3. queries and validates the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at (see
   (#signalingnames); `ns3.example.co.uk` is ignored because it is in
   bailiwick)

```
_dsboot.example.co.uk._signal.ns1.example.net
_dsboot.example.co.uk._signal.ns2.example.org
```

4. checks that the CDS/CDNSKEY record sets retrieved in Steps 2
   and 3 agree across responses.

If all these steps succeed, the Parental Agent can proceed to publish
a DS record set as indicated by the validated CDS/CDNSKEY records.

The Parental Agent does not use in-bailiwick Signaling Names during
validation because they cannot have a pre-established chain of trust at
bootstrapping time, so are not useful for bootstrapping.
Consequently, if all NS hostnames are in bailiwick, validation cannot be
completed, and DS records are not published.

{#triggers}
## Triggers

Parental Agents SHOULD trigger the procedure described in (#cds-auth)
once one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

  - The Parental Agent receives a new or updated NS record set for a
    Child;

  - The Parental Agent encounters a Signaling Record during a proactive,
    opportunistic scan (e.g. daily queries of Signaling Records for some
    or all of its delegations);

  - The Parental Agent encounters a Signaling Record during an NSEC walk
    or when parsing a Signaling Zone (e.g. when made available via AXFR
    by the Child DNS Operator);

  - Any other condition as deemed appropriate by local policy.

Most types of discovery (such as daily scans of delegations) are based
directly on the delegation's NS record set.
In this case, these NS names can be used as is by the bootstrapping
algorithm ((#cds-auth)) for querying Signaling Records.

Some discovery methods, however, do not imply reliable knowledge of the
Child's NS record set.
For example, when discovering Signaling Names by performing an NSEC
walk or zone transfer of a Signaling Zone, the Parental Agent MUST NOT
assume that the nameserver(s) under whose Signaling Domain(s) a
Signaling Name appears is in fact authoritative for the corresponding
Child.

In this case (and in other cases alike where some list of
"bootstrappable domains" is retrieved from elsewhere), the Parental
Agent MUST ascertain that the Child's delegation actually contains the
nameserver hostname seen during discovery, and ensure that Signaling
Record queries are only made against the proper set of nameservers as
listed in the Child's delegation from the Parent.


{#limitations}
## Limitations

As a consequence of Step 3 in (#cds-auth), DS bootstrapping does not
work for fully in-bailiwick delegations, as no pre-existing chain of
trust to the Child domain is available during bootstrapping.
(As a workaround, one can add an out-of-bailiwick nameserver to the
initial NS record set and remove it once bootstrapping is completed.
Automation for this is available via CSYNC records, see [@!RFC7477].)

The protocol is further restricted by the fact that the fully
qualified Signaling Names fit within the general limits that apply to
DNS names (such as their length and label count).


# Operational Recommendations

## Child DNS Operator

CDS/CDNSKEY records and corresponding signaling records MUST NOT be
published without the zone owner's consent.
Likewise, the Child DNS Operator MUST enable the zone owner to signal
the desire to turn off DNSSEC by publication of the special-value
CDS/CDNSKEY RRset specified in [@!RFC8078] Section 4.
To facilitate transitions between DNS operators, Child DNS Operators
SHOULD support the multi-signer protocols described in [@RFC8901].

Signaling Domains SHOULD be delegated as zones of their own, so
that the Signaling Zone's apex coincides with the Signaling
Domain (such as `_signal.ns1.example.net`).
While it is permissible for the Signaling Domain to be contained
in a Signaling Zone of fewer labels (such as `example.net`), a
zone cut ensures that bootstrapping activities do not require
modifications of the zone containing the nameserver hostname.

To keep the size of the Signaling Zones minimal and bulk processing
efficient (such as via zone transfers), Child DNS Operators SHOULD
remove Signaling Records which are found to have been acted upon.

## Parental Agent

It is RECOMMENDED to perform queries within Signaling Domains
((#cds-auth)) with an (initially) cold resolver cache or to limit the
TTL of cached records to the interval between scans, as to retrieve the
most current information regardless of TTL.
(When a batch job is used to attempt bootstrapping for a large number
of delegations, the cache does not need to get cleared in between
queries pertaining to different Children.)


# Security Considerations

The DNSSEC bootstrapping method introduced in this document is based on
the (now deprecated) approaches described in [@!RFC8078] Section 3, but
adds authentication to the CDS/CDNSKEY concept.
Its security level is therefore strictly higher than that of existing
approaches described in that document (e.g. "Accept after Delay").
Apart from this general improvement, the same Security Considerations
apply as in [@!RFC8078].

The level of rigor in (#cds-auth) is needed to prevent publication of a
half-baked DS RRset (authorized only under a subset of NS hostnames).
This ensures, for example, that an operator in a multi-homed setup
cannot enable DNSSEC unless all other operators agree.

Because the parents of a Signaling Domain (such as the corresponding TLD
registry) are in control of its chain of trust, they are also able to
undermine the signal's authenticity.
To mitigate this risk, it is RECOMMENDED to increase the effort required
to collude for taking control of all Signaling Domains, by diversifying
the path from the root to each nameserver.
This is best achieved by using different and independently operated TLDs
for each one.
(TLD-independent NS hostnames are advisable anyways in DNS operations,
in order to prevent the TLD from becoming a single point of failure.)
Furthermore, as the Child DNS Operator has authoritative knowledge of
the Child's CDS/CDNSKEY records, it can readily detect fraudulent
provisioning of DS records.


# IANA Considerations

Per [@!RFC8552], IANA is requested to add the following entries to the
"Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry:

    +---------+------------+-----------------------------------------+
    | RR Type | _NODE NAME | Reference                               |
    +---------+------------+-----------------------------------------+
    | CDS     | _signal    | [draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-bootstrapping] |
    | CDNSKEY | _signal    | [draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-bootstrapping] |
    +---------+------------+-----------------------------------------+
