           Authenticated Bootstrapping of DNSSEC Delegations
             draft-thomassen-dnsop-dnssec-bootstrapping-00

Abstract

   This document describes an authenticated in-band method for automatic
   signaling of a Child DNS zone's delegation signer information from
   the zone's DNS operator(s).  The zone's registrar or registry may
   subsequently use this signal for automatic DS record provisioning in
   the parent zone.

1.  Introduction

   *TODO remove*: this section is inspired by [RFC7344], Section 1.

   The first time a Child DNS Operator signs a zone, they need to
   communicate the keying material to the Parent.  Depending on the
   desires of the Parent, the Child might send their DNSKEY record, a DS
   record, or both.

   So far, out-of-band methods are typically used to complete the chain
   of trust.  In-band methods exist, in particular based on the CDS and
   CDNSKEY record types as specified in [RFC7344] and [RFC8078].
   However, such communication is only authenticated when performing a
   rollover of the Child's keys represented in the parent.  An
   authenticated in-band channel for enabling DNSSEC so far has been
   missing.

   How the keying material is conveyed to the Parent during initial
   DNSSEC bootstrapping depends on the relationship the Child has with
   the Parent.  The communication has to occur between the Child DNS
   Operator and, depending on the circumstances, the Registry or the
   Registrar, possibly via the Registrant (for details, see [RFC7344],
   Appendix A).  In many cases, this is a manual process -- and not an
   easy one.  Any manual process is susceptible to mistakes and/or

   errors.  In addition, due to the annoyance factor of the process,
   involved parties may avoid the process of getting a DS record set
   published at the Parent.

   DNSSEC provides data integrity to information published in DNS; thus,
   DNS publication can be used to automate maintenance of delegation
   information.  This document describes a method to automate
   publication of initial DS records for a hitherto insecure delegation.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC6781], [RFC7344], and [RFC8078].

   This document describes a method for automated provisioning of the
   delegation trust information and proposes a simple provisioning
   trigger mechanism.  Some users may prefer a different trigger.  These
   alternate additional triggers are not discussed in this document.

1.1.  Terminology

   The terminology we use is defined in this section.  The highlighted
   roles are as follows:

   Child  The entity on record that has the delegation of the domain
      from the Parent.

   Parent  The domain in which the Child is registered.

   Child DNS Operator  The entity that maintains and publishes the zone
      information for the Child DNS.

   Parental Agent  The entity that the Child has a relationship with to
      change its delegation information.

   Bootstrapping Domain(s)  For any given authoritative nameserver
      hostname from the Child's NS record set, the hostname prefixed
      with the label "_boot" is one of the Bootstrapping Domains for the
      Child Zone.

   Bootstrapping Zone  The zone which is authoritative for a given
      Bootstrapping Domain.

   Signaling Name  A Bootstrapping Domain prefixed with a label derived
      from the Child zone's name.

   CDS/CDNSKEY  This notation refers to CDS and/or CDNSKEY, i.e., one or
      both.

   Base32hex Encoding  "Base 32 Encoding with Extended Hex Alphabet" as

      per [RFC4648].

1.2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Description

   When setting up initial trust, the child generally wants to enable
   global validation.  As long as the child is insecure, DNS answers can
   be forged.  The goal is to promote the child from insecure to secure
   as soon as reasonably possible by the parent.  This means that the
   period from the child's publication of CDS/CDNSKEY RRset to the
   parent publishing the synchronized DS RRset should be as short as
   possible.

   This goal is achieved by transferring trust from the Child DNS
   Operator.  Implementation by Child DNS Operators and Parental Agents
   is RECOMMENDED.

2.1.  Preconditions

   If a Child DNS Operator implements the protocol, the following
   conditions have to be met:

   1.  The Child DNS Operator SHOULD publish CDS/CDNSKEY records at the
       Child's apex, as described in [RFC7344].

   2.  Each Bootstrapping Zone MUST be part securely delegated zone,
       i.e. have a valid DNSSEC chain of trust from the root.

2.1.1.  Example

   When performing DNSSEC bootstrapping for the Child zone "example.com"
   using NS records "ns1.example.net" and "ns2.example.net", the Child
   DNS Operator

   1.  should publish CDS/CDNSKEY records at "example.com";

   2.  needs to ensure that a valid DNSSEC chain of trust exists for the
       zone(s) that are authoritative for the Bootstrapping Domains
       "_boot.ns1.example.net" and "_boot.ns2.example.net".

2.2.  Signaling Intent to Act as the Child's Signer

   To signal that a Child DNS Operator whishes to act as the Child's
   delegated signer, the Child DNS Operator MUST publish one or more
   signaling records at the Child's Signaling Name under each
   Bootstrapping Domain.  The signaling records are

   *  a PTR record containing the Child's name as the target;

   *  one or more other DNS records, depending on the specific use case
      as described below.

   These records MUST be accompanied by RRSIG records created with the
   corresponding Bootstrapping Zone's key(s).

   The Signaling Name contains a label derived from the Child's name.
   This label MUST be equal to the SHA-256 hash digest of the Child's
   name in "Base 32 Encoding with Extended Hex Alphabet", as specified
   in [RFC4648].  Trailing padding characters ("=") MUST be dropped.

   *TODO Remove Note 1:* The purpose of the hash function is to avoid
   the possibility of exceeding the maximum length of a DNS name.  This
   could occur if the Child name was used as is.

   *TODO Remove Note 2:* The encoding choice is like in NSEC3, except
   that SHA-256 is used instead of SHA-1.  This is to prevent other
   tenants in shared hosting environments from creating collisions.

   *TODO Remove Note 3:* To support DNS operators with many zones, the
   Signaling Name should support sharding of Child names, i.e., be
   separated into a couple of labels.

2.3.  Bootstrapping a DNSSEC Delegation

2.3.1.  Signaling Records

   To announce its willingness to act as the Child's delegated signer,
   the Child DNS operator publishes a copy of the Child's CDS/CDNSKEY
   records at the corresponding Signaling Name under each Bootstrapping
   Domain as defined in Section 2.2.

   Previous use of CDS/CDNSKEY records is specified at the apex only
   ([RFC7344], Section 4.1).  This protocol extends the use of these
   record types at non-apex owner names for the purpose of DNSSEC
   bootstrapping.  To exclude the possibility of semantic collision,
   there MUST NOT be a zone cut at a Signaling Name.

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 July 2021


   Unlike the CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child's apex, bootstrapping
   records MUST be signed with the corresponding Bootstrapping Zone's
   key(s).

2.3.1.1.  Example

   For the purposes of bootstrapping the Child zone "example.com" with
   NS records "ns1.example.net" and "ns2.example.net", the required
   Bootstrapping Domains are "_boot.ns1.example.net" and
   "_boot.ns2.example.net".  In the zones containing these domains, the
   Child DNS Operator

   *  publishes a PTR record pointing to "example.com.", and

   *  publishes the Child's CDS/CDNSKEY records

   at the names

kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns1.example.net
kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns2.example.net

   where "kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g" is
   derived from the DNS Child Zone's name "example.com".  The records
   are accompanied by RRSIG records created using the key(s) of the
   respective Bootstrapping Zone.

   *TODO:* 1.)  Should hash input include trailing dot? 2.)  Should hash
   input include bootstrapping domain (to prevent DNAME redirects)?
   (Command was: "echo -n example.com | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 |
   base32hex | tr -d =") 3.)  Should the hash use wire format?

2.3.2.  Steps Taken by the Parental Agent

   When a Parental Agent implementing this protocol receives a new or
   updated NS record set for a Child, the Parental Agent, knowing both
   the Child zone name and its NS hostnames,

   1.  MUST verify that the Child is not currently securely delegated;

   2.  MUST query the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at the Child zone
       apex, directly from each of the authoritative nameservers as
       given in the Child NS record set;

   3.  MUST query the PTR record located at each of the Signaling Names
       and verify that its content matches the Child's name;

   4.  MUST query the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at each of the
       Signaling Names;



Thomassen & Wisiol       Expires 10 January 2022                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 July 2021


   5.  MUST check (separately by record type) that all record sets
       retrieved in Steps 2 (if present), 3 and 4 have equal contents;

   6.  SHOULD derive a DS record set from the retrieved CDS/CDNSKEY
       record sets and publish it in the Parent zone, so as to secure
       the Child's delegation.

   For the above queries, the Parental Agent MUST use a trusted
   validating DNS resolver and MUST treat responses with unauthenticated
   data (AD bit not set) as an error condition, unless indicated
   otherwise.

   If an error condition occurs before Step 6, in particular:

   *  The Child is already securely delegated (Step 1),

   *  Any failure during the retrieval of the CDS/CDNSKEY records
      located at the Child apex from the Child's authoritative
      nameservers (Step 2), with an empty record set returned from all
      authoritative nameservers not qualifying as a failure,

   *  The PTR record does not match (Step 3),

   *  DNS resolution failure during retrieval of CDS/CDNSKEY records
      from any Signaling Name, or failure of DNSSEC validation (Step 4),

   *  Inconsistent responses (Step 5),

   the Parental Agent MUST abort the procedure.

   In addition to triggering this procedure whenever the Child's NS
   records are updated, the Parental Agent MAY also trigger the
   procedure at any other time deemed appropriate by local policy.

2.3.2.1.  Example

   To bootstrap the Child zone "example.com" using NS records
   "ns1.example.net" and "ns2.example.net", the Parental Agent

1.  checks that the Child zone is not yet securely delegated;

2.  queries CDS/CDNSKEY records for "example.com" directly from
    "ns1.example.net" and "ns2.example.net";

3.  queries the PTR record located at the Signaling Names

kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns1.example.net
kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns2.example.net

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 July 2021


    and verifies that the record content is "example.com.";

4.  queries CDS/CDNSKEY records located at the same Signaling Names;

5.  checks that the PTR record sets retrieved in Step 3 agree across
    responses; ditto for the CDS/CDNSKEY record sets retrieved in
    Steps 2 and 4;

6.  publishes a DS record set according to the information retrieved
    in the previous steps.

2.3.2.2.  Opt-out

   As a special case of Step 2 failure, the Child MAY opt out from
   DNSSEC bootstrapping by publishing a CDS/CDNSKEY record with
   algorithm 0 and other fields as specified in [RFC8078], Section 4, at
   its apex.

   This mechanism is without regard to whether the Child zone's
   signatures are managed by the Child DNS Operator or by the zone
   owner, and without regard to what the Child DNS Operator decides to
   signal under the Bootstrapping Domain.

2.4.  Possible Extensions

   By provisioning other types of signaling records, the Child DNS
   Operator can convey signals that pertain to use cases other than
   bootstrapping a DNSSEC delegation.

2.4.1.  Multi-Signer Setups: Onboarding a Signing Party

   [RFC8901] describes multi-signer models in which several Child DNS
   Operators serve the same Child zone.  In one of these scenarios
   (Model 2, [RFC8901], Section 2.1.2), each Child DNS Operator holds a
   unique KSK set and ZSK set to sign the zone.

   To ensure smooth resolution of Child zone queries, this scheme
   demands that participating Child DNS Operators import the ZSK sets of
   the other providers into their DNSKEY RRset.  When a new Child DNS
   Operator is joining the scheme, this synchronization has to occur
   before the new operator's nameserver hostnames are included in the
   Child's NS record set.  So far, it has been assumed that the ZSK
   export/import would happen through some proprietary API at each DNS
   operator.

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 July 2021


   However, the mechanism described in Section 2.2 provides a public,
   authenticated, in-band, read-only interface to the Child DNS
   Operator.  It can therefore be used by a Child DNS Operator to make
   its own set of DNSKEY records available for querying by other signing
   parties, so that they can retrieve, validate, and import them.

2.4.1.1.  Signaling Records

   Given a Child zone "example.com" that is already securely delegated
   with authoritative nameservers "ns1.example.net" and
   "ns2.example.net", we consider how a new Child DNS Operator using
   nameservers "ns3.example.org" and "ns4.example.org" can distribute
   its ZSK set to the existing signing parties, in order to join the
   multi-signer group.

   The Bootstrapping Domains corresponding to the new Child DNS
   Operator's nameservers are "_boot.ns3.example.org" and
   "_boot.ns4.example.org".  In the zones containing these domains, the
   new Child DNS Operator

   *  publishes a PTR record pointing to "example.com.", and

   *  publishes a DNSKEY record set containing the ZSK set that the
      operator will use for signing the Child zone,

   at the names

kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns3.example.org
kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns4.example.org

   where the first label is calculated as described above.  The records
   are accompanied by RRSIG records created using the key(s) of the
   respective Bootstrapping Zone.

   Note that DNSKEY records are not restricted to apex owner names
   ([RFC4035], Section 2.1).  However, only apex DNSKEY records are used
   for DNSSEC validation ([RFC4035], Section 5).  As Signaling Names do
   not occur on zone cuts (see Section 2.3.1), the use of DNSKEY records
   described here does not interfere with existing DNSKEY uses.

2.4.1.2.  Import

   Once the owner of "example.com" informs the existing signing parties
   of the joining Child DNS Operator's nameserver hostnames, the
   existing parties can use an algorithm similar to the one given in
   Section 2.3.2 to query and validate the joining operator's ZSK set,
   and then include it in their DNSKEY sets.

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 July 2021


   To finish the joining process, CDS/CDNSKEY records may be used to
   propagate the joint delegation signer information to the parent
   ([RFC8901], Section 8).  Signing parties can then synchronize the
   Child's NS record set to include the joining operator's authoritative
   hostnames, and use CSYNC to amend the NS record set at the Parent.

2.5.  Operational Recommendations

   Bootstrapping Domains SHOULD be delegated as zones of their own, so
   that the Bootstrapping Zone's apex coincides with the Bootstrapping
   Domain (such as "_boot.ns1.example.net").  While it is permissible
   for the Bootstrapping Domain to be contained in a Bootstrapping Zone
   of fewer labels (such as "example.net"), a zone cut ensures that
   bootstrapping activities do not require modifications of the zone
   containing the nameserver hostname.

   In addition, Bootstrapping Zones SHOULD use NSEC to allow consumers
   to efficiently discover pending bootstrapping operations by means of
   zone walking.  This is especially useful for bulk processing after a
   Child DNS Operator has enabled the protocol.

   To keep the size of the Bootstrapping Zones minimal and zone walking
   efficient, Child DNS operators SHOULD remove signaling records which
   are found to have been acted upon, including the PTR record (when all
   other signaling records have been removed for a given Signaling
   Name).

3.  Implementation Status

   *Note to the RFC Editor*: please remove this entire section before
   publication.

   *  Knot DNS supports manual creation of CDS/CDNSKEY records on non-
      apex names.

   *  PowerDNS supports manual creation of CDS/CDNSKEY records on non-
      apex names.

   *  Proof-of-concept bootstrapping domains exist at
      "_boot.ns1.desec.io" and "_boot.ns2.desec.org".  Signaling Names
      can be discovered via NSEC walking.  Child zones can be discovered
      by querying PTR for a Signaling Name.

4.  Security Considerations

   Thoughts (to be expanded):

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 July 2021


   *  We use at least one established chain of trust (via the secure
      delegations of the zones containing the NS hostnames).  As a
      result,

      -  communication is authenticated;

      -  process is immediate (no need for observing CDS/CDNSKEY records
         via TCP for several days);

      -  an active on-wire attacker cannot tamper with the delegation.

   *  When validating against CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child's apex,
      the security level of the method is strictly higher than the
      "accept CDS/CDNSKEY after a while"-approch that is already in use
      at several ccTLD registries ("Accept after Delay", [RFC8078],
      Section 3.3).  This is because the method described here adds
      stronger guarantees, but removes nothing.  Perhaps this means that
      co-publication of CDS/CDNSKEY at the Child apex should be
      mandatory.  (This in turn may interact somehow with the Child's
      opt-out option.)

   *  Actors in the chain(s) of trust of the zone(s) used for
      bootstrapping (the DNS Operator themselves, plus entities further
      up in the chain) can undermine the protocol.  However,

      -  that's also possible in the case of CDS/CDNSKEY (see previous
         point);

      -  if the Child DNS Operator doesn't control the zones in which
         its NS hostnames live (including their nameservers' A records)
         because the path from the root is untrusted, you probably don't
         want to trust that operator as a whole;

      -  when bootstrapping is done upon receipt of a new NS record set,
         the window of opportunity is very small (and easily monitored
         by the Child DNS operator);

      -  mitigation exists by diversifying e.g. the nameserver
         hostname's TLDs, which is advisable anyways.

   *  Prevention of accidental misprovisioning / enforcing explicit
      provisioning:

      -  In addition to facilitating Child zone discovery and
         simplifying debugging, the Child-specific PTR record also
         prevents the use of wildcards records under the Bootstrapping
         Domain.  As a result, signaling records have to be provisioned
         explicitly.

      -  Similarly, operators could deflect a Bootstrapping Domain onto
         another one, by means of a DNAME record.  This can be prevented
         by incorporating the Bootstrapping Domain's name into the hash
         used to construct the Signal Name.

5.  IANA Considerations

   *TODO:* reserve "_boot"?

   This document has no IANA actions.
