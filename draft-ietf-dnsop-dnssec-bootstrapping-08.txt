  Automatic DNSSEC Bootstrapping using Authenticated Signals from the
                            Zone's Operator
                draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-bootstrapping-08

Abstract

   This document introduces an in-band method for DNS operators to
   publish arbitrary information about the zones they are authoritative
   for, in an authenticated fashion and on a per-zone basis.  The
   mechanism allows managed DNS operators to securely announce DNSSEC
   key parameters for zones under their management, including for zones
   that are not currently securely delegated.

   Whenever DS records are absent for a zone's delegation, this signal
   enables the parent's registry or registrar to cryptographically
   validate the CDS/CDNSKEY records found at the child's apex.  The
   parent can then provision DS records for the delegation without
   resorting to out-of-band validation or weaker types of cross-checks
   such as "Accept after Delay".

   This document deprecates the DS enrollment methods described in
   Section 3 of RFC 8078 in favor of Section 4 of this document, and
   also updates RFC 7344.

1.  Introduction

   Securing a DNS delegation for the first time requires that the
   child's DNSSEC parameters be conveyed to the parent through some
   trusted channel.  While the communication conceptually has to occur
   between the parent registry and the DNSSEC key holder, what exactly
   that means and how the communication is coordinated traditionally
   depends on the relationship the child has with the parent.

   A typical situation is that the key is held by the child DNS
   operator; the communication thus often involves this entity.  In
   addition, depending on the circumstances, it may also involve the
   Registrar, possibly via the Registrant (for details, see [RFC7344],
   Appendix A).

   As observed in [RFC7344], these dependencies often result in a manual
   process that is susceptible to mistakes and/or errors.  In addition,
   due to the annoyance factor of the process, involved parties may
   avoid the process of getting a DS record set published in the first
   place.

   To alleviate these problems, automated provisioning of DS records has
   been specified in ([RFC8078]).  It is based on the parental agent
   (registry or registrar) fetching DNSSEC key parameters from the CDS
   and CDNSKEY records ([RFC7344]) located at the child zone's apex, and
   validating them somehow.  This validation can be done using the
   child's existing DNSSEC chain of trust if the objective is to update
   an existing DS record set (such as during key rollover).  However,
   when bootstrapping a DNSSEC delegation, the child zone has no
   existing DNSSEC validation path, and other means to ensure the CDS/
   CDNSKEY records' legitimacy must be found.

   Due to the lack of a comprehensive DNS-innate solution, either out-
   of-band methods have been used so far to complete the chain of trust,
   or cryptographic validation has been entirely dispensed with, in
   exchange for weaker types of cross-checks such as "Accept after
   Delay" ([RFC8078] Section 3.3).  [RFC8078] does not define an in-band
   validation method for enabling DNSSEC.

   This document aims to close this gap by introducing an in-band method
   for DNS operators to publish arbitrary information about the zones
   they are authoritative for, in an authenticated manner and on a per-
   zone basis.  The mechanism allows managed DNS operators to securely
   announce DNSSEC key parameters for zones under their management.  The

   parent can then use this signal to cryptographically validate the
   CDS/CDNSKEY records found at an insecure child zone's apex and, upon
   success, secure the delegation.

   While applicable to the vast majority of domains, the protocol does
   not support certain edge cases, such as excessively long child zone
   names, or DNSSEC bootstrapping for domains with in-bailick
   nameservers only (see Section 4.4).

   DNSSEC bootstrapping is just one application of the generic signaling
   mechanism specified in this document.  Other applications might arise
   in the future, such as publishing operational metadata or auxiliary
   information which the DNS operator likes to make known (e.g., API
   endpoints for third-party interaction).

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC6781], [RFC7344], and [RFC8078].

1.1.  Terminology

   This section defines the terminology used in this document.

   CDS/CDNSKEY  This notation refers to CDS and/or CDNSKEY, i.e., one or
      both.

   Child  see [RFC8499] Section 7

   Child DNS operator  The entity that maintains and publishes the zone
      information for the child DNS.

   Parent  see [RFC8499] Section 7

   Parental agent  The entity that has the authority to insert DS
      records into the parent zone on behalf of the child.  (It could be
      the registry, registrar, a reseller, or some other authorized
      entity.)

   Signaling domain  A hostname from the child's NS record set, prefixed
      with the label _signal.  There are as many signaling domains as
      there are distinct NS targets.

   Signaling name  The labels that are prefixed to a signaling domain in
      order to identify a signaling type and a child zone's name (see
      Section 3.2).

   Signaling record  A DNS record located at a signaling name under a
      signaling domain.  Signaling records are used by the child DNS
      operator to publish information about the child.

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                April 2024


   Signaling type  A signal type identifier, such as _dsboot for DNSSEC
      bootstrapping.

   Signaling zone  The zone which is authoritative for a given signaling
      record.

1.2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updates to RFCs

   The DS enrollment methods described in Section 3 of [RFC8078] are
   deprecated and SHOULD NOT be used.  Child DNS operators and parental
   agents who wish to use CDS/CDNSKEY records for initial DS enrollment
   SHOULD instead support the authentication protocol described in
   Section 4 of this document.

   In order to facilitate publication of signaling records for the
   purpose of DNSSEC bootstrapping (see Section 4.1), the first bullet
   ("Location") of [RFC7344] Section 4.1 is removed.

3.  Signaling

   This section describes the general mechanism by which a child DNS
   operator can publish an authenticated signal about a child zone.
   Parental agents (or any other party) can then discover and process
   the signal.  Authenticity is ensured through standard DNSSEC
   validation.

3.1.  Chain of Trust

   If a child DNS operator implements the protocol, each signaling zone
   MUST be signed and be validatable by the parental agent (i.e. have a
   valid DNSSEC chain of trust).  This is typically achieved by securely
   delegating each signaling zone.

   For example, when publishing a signal that relates to a child zone
   with NS records ns1.example.net and ns2.example.org, the child DNS
   operator needs to ensure that the parental agent has a valid DNSSEC
   chain of trust for the zone(s) that are authoritative for the
   signaling domains _signal.ns1.example.net and
   _signal.ns2.example.org.

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                April 2024


3.2.  Signaling Names

   To publish information about the child zone in an authenticated
   fashion, the child DNS operator MUST publish one or more signaling
   records at a signaling name under each signaling domain.

   Signaling records MUST be accompanied by RRSIG records created with
   the corresponding signaling zone's key(s).  The type and contents of
   these signaling records depend on the type of signal.

   The signaling name identifies the child and the signaling type.  It
   is identical to the child name (with the final root label removed),
   prefixed with a label containing the signaling type.

4.  Bootstrapping a DNSSEC Delegation

   When the child zone's CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets are used for setting up
   initial trust, they need to be authenticated.  This is achieved by
   co-publishing the child's CDS/CDNSKEY records as an authenticated
   signal as described in Section 3.  The parent can discover and
   validate it, thus transferring trust from the child DNS operator
   nameservers' chain of trust to the child zone.

   This protocol is not intended for updating an existing DS RRset.  For
   this purpose, the parental agent can validate the child's CDS/CDNSKEY
   records directly, using the chain of trust established by the
   existing DS RRset ([RFC7344] Section 4).

4.1.  Signaling Consent to Act as the Child's Signer

   To confirm its willingness to act as the child's delegated signer and
   authenticate the child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets, the child DNS operator
   MUST co-publish them at the corresponding signaling name under each
   out-of-bailiwick signaling domain (Section 3.2).  For simplicity, the
   child DNS operator MAY also co-publish the child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets
   under signaling domains that are in bailiwick, although those
   signaling domains are not used for validation (Section 4.2).

   Unlike the CDS/CDNSKEY records at the child's apex, signaling records
   MUST be signed with the corresponding signaling zone's key(s).  Their
   contents MUST be identical to the corresponding records published at
   the child's apex.

   Existing use of CDS/CDNSKEY records was specified at the child apex
   only ([RFC7344], Section 4.1).  This protocol extends the use of
   these record types to non-apex owner names for the purpose of DNSSEC
   bootstrapping.  To exclude the possibility of semantic collision,
   there MUST NOT be a zone cut at a signaling name.

   To avoid relying on the benevolence of a single signaling domain
   parent (such as the corresponding TLD registry), it is RECOMMENDED to
   diversify the path from the root to the child's nameserver hostnames.
   This is best achieved by using different and independently operated
   TLDs for each one.

4.1.1.  Example

   For the purposes of bootstrapping the child zone example.co.uk with
   NS records ns1.example.net, ns2.example.org, and ns3.example.co.uk,
   the required signaling domains are _signal.ns1.example.net and
   _signal.ns2.example.org.

   In the zones containing these domains, the child DNS operator
   authenticates the CDS/CDNSKEY records found at the child's apex by
   co-publishing them at the names:

   _dsboot.example.co.uk._signal.ns1.example.net
   _dsboot.example.co.uk._signal.ns2.example.org

   The records are accompanied by RRSIG records created using the key(s)
   of the respective signaling zone.

   Publication of signaling records under the in-bailiwick domain
   _signal.ns3.example.co.uk is not required.

4.2.  Validating CDS/CDNSKEY Records for DNSSEC Bootstrapping

   To validate a child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRset for DNSSEC bootstrapping, the
   parental agent, knowing both the child zone name and its NS
   hostnames, MUST execute the following steps:

   1.  verify that the child is not currently securely delegated and
       that at least one of its nameservers is out of bailiwick;

   2.  query the CDS/CDNSKEY records at the child zone apex directly
       from each of the authoritative servers as determined by the
       delegation's NS record set (without caching);

   3.  query the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at the signaling name under
       each out-of-bailiwick signaling domain using a trusted DNS
       resolver and enforce DNSSEC validation;

   4.  check (separately by record type) that all record sets retrieved
       in Steps 2 and 3 have equal contents;

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                April 2024


   If the above steps succeed without error, the CDS/CDNSKEY records are
   successfully validated, and the parental agent can proceed with the
   publication of the DS record set under the precautions described in
   [RFC8078], Section 5.

   However, the parental agent MUST abort the procedure if an error
   condition occurs, in particular:

   *  in Step 1: the child is already securely delegated or has in-
      bailiwick nameservers only;

   *  in Step 2: any failure during the retrieval of the CDS/CDNSKEY
      records located at the child apex from any of the authoritative
      nameservers;

   *  in Step 3: any failure to retrieve the CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets located
      at the signaling name under any signaling domain, including
      failure of DNSSEC validation, or unauthenticated data (AD bit not
      set);

   *  in Step 4: inconsistent responses (for at least one of the types),
      including a record set that is empty in one of Steps 2 or 3, but
      non-empty in the other.

4.2.1.  Example

   To verify the CDS/CDNSKEY records for the child example.co.uk, the
   parental agent (assuming that the child delegation's NS records are
   ns1.example.net, ns2.example.org, and ns3.example.co.uk)

   1.  checks that the child domain is not yet securely delegated;

   2.  queries CDS/CDNSKEY records for example.co.uk directly from
       ns1.example.net, ns2.example.org, and ns3.example.co.uk (without
       caching);

   3.  queries and validates the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at (see
       Section 3.2; ns3.example.co.uk is ignored because it is in
       bailiwick)

   _dsboot.example.co.uk._signal.ns1.example.net
   _dsboot.example.co.uk._signal.ns2.example.org

   4.  checks that the CDS/CDNSKEY record sets retrieved in Steps 2 and
       3 agree across responses.

   If all these steps succeed, the parental agent can proceed to publish
   a DS record set as indicated by the validated CDS/CDNSKEY records.

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                April 2024


   As in-bailiwick signaling names do not have a chain of trust at
   bootstrapping time, the parental agent does not consider them during
   validation.  Consequently, if all NS hostnames are in bailiwick,
   validation cannot be completed, and DS records are not published.

4.3.  Triggers

   Parental agents SHOULD trigger the procedure described in Section 4.2
   once one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

   *  The parental agent receives a new or updated NS record set for a
      child;

   *  The parental agent receives a notification indicating that the
      child wishes to have its CDS/CDNSKEY RRset processed;

   *  The parental agent encounters a signaling record during a
      proactive, opportunistic scan (e.g. daily queries of signaling
      records for some or all of its delegations);

   *  The parental agent encounters a signaling record during an NSEC
      walk or when parsing a signaling zone (e.g. when made available
      via AXFR by the child DNS operator);

   *  Any other condition as deemed appropriate by local policy.

   Timer-based trigger mechanisms (such as scans) exhibit undesirable
   properties with respect to processing delay and scaling; on-demand
   triggers (like notifications) are preferable.  Whenever possible,
   child DNS operators and parental agents are thus encouraged to use
   them, reducing both delays and the amount of scanning traffic.

   Most types of discovery (such as daily scans of delegations) are
   based directly on the delegation's NS record set.  In this case,
   these NS names can be used as is by the bootstrapping algorithm
   (Section 4.2) for querying signaling records.

   Some discovery methods, however, do not imply reliable knowledge of
   the child's NS record set.  For example, when discovering signaling
   names by performing an NSEC walk or zone transfer of a signaling
   zone, the parental agent MUST NOT assume that the nameserver(s) under
   whose signaling domain(s) a signaling name appears is actually
   authoritative for the corresponding child.

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                April 2024


   Instead, whenever a list of "bootstrappable domains" is obtained
   other than directly from the parent, the parental agent MUST
   ascertain that the child's delegation actually contains the
   nameserver hostname seen during discovery, and ensure that signaling
   record queries are only made against the proper set of nameservers as
   listed in the child's delegation from the parent.

4.4.  Limitations

   As a consequence of Step 3 in Section 4.2, DS bootstrapping does not
   work for fully in-bailiwick delegations, as no pre-existing chain of
   trust to the child domain is available during bootstrapping.  (As a
   workaround, one can add an out-of-bailiwick nameserver to the initial
   NS record set and remove it once bootstrapping is completed.
   Automation for this is available via CSYNC records, see [RFC7477].)

   Fully qualified signaling names must by valid DNS names.  Label count
   and length requirements for DNS names imply that the protocol does
   not work for unusually long child domain names or NS hostnames.

5.  Operational Recommendations

5.1.  Child DNS Operator

   CDS/CDNSKEY records and corresponding signaling records MUST NOT be
   published without the zone owner's consent.  Likewise, the child DNS
   operator MUST enable the zone owner to signal the desire to turn off
   DNSSEC by publication of the special-value CDS/CDNSKEY RRset
   specified in [RFC8078] Section 4.  To facilitate transitions between
   DNS operators, child DNS operators SHOULD support the multi-signer
   protocols described in [RFC8901].

   Signaling domains SHOULD be delegated as standalone zones, so that
   the signaling zone's apex coincides with the signaling domain (such
   as _signal.ns1.example.net).  While it is permissible for the
   signaling domain to be contained in a signaling zone of fewer labels
   (such as example.net), a zone cut ensures that bootstrapping
   activities do not require modifications of the zone containing the
   nameserver hostname.

   Once a Child DNS Operator determines that specific signaling records
   have been processed (e.g., by seeing the result in the parent zone),
   they are advised to remove them.  This will reduce the size of the
   Signaling Zone, and facilitate more efficient bulk processing (such
   as via zone transfers).

5.2.  Parental Agent

   In order to ensure timely DNSSEC bootstrapping of insecure domains,
   stalemate situations due to mismatch of cached records (Step 4 of
   Section 4.2) need to be avoided.  It is thus RECOMMENDED to perform
   queries into signaling domains with an (initially) cold resolver
   cache, or to disable caching for them (e.g., by limiting response
   TTLs to the interval between scans).

6.  Security Considerations

   The DNSSEC bootstrapping method introduced in this document is based
   on the (now deprecated) approaches described in [RFC8078] Section 3,
   but adds authentication to the CDS/CDNSKEY concept.  Its security
   level is therefore strictly higher than that of existing approaches
   described in that document (e.g.  "Accept after Delay").  Apart from
   this general improvement, the same Security Considerations apply as
   in [RFC8078].

   The level of rigor in Section 4.2 is needed to prevent publication of
   a half-baked DS RRset (authorized only under a subset of NS
   hostnames).  This ensures, for example, that an operator in a multi-
   homed setup cannot enable DNSSEC unless all other operators agree.

   In any case, as the child DNS operator has authoritative knowledge of
   the child's CDS/CDNSKEY records, it can readily detect fraudulent
   provisioning of DS records.

   In order to prevent the TLD of nameserver hostnames from becoming a
   single point of failure for a delegation (both in terms of resolution
   availability and for the trust model of this protocol), it is
   advisable to use NS hostnames that are independent from each other
   with respect to their TLD.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Per [RFC8552], IANA is requested to add the following entries to the
   "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry:

   +---------+------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | RR Type | _NODE NAME | Reference                               |
   +---------+------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | CDS     | _signal    | [draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-bootstrapping] |
   | CDNSKEY | _signal    | [draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-bootstrapping] |
   +---------+------------+-----------------------------------------+

8.  Implementation Status

   *Note to the RFC Editor*: please remove this entire section before
   publication.

   In addition to the information in this section, deployment is tracked
   by the community at https://github.com/oskar456/cds-updates
   (https://github.com/oskar456/cds-updates).

8.1.  Child DNS Operator-side

   *  Operator support:

      -  Cloudflare has implemented bootstrapping record synthesis for
         all signed customer zones.

      -  Glauca HexDNS publishes bootstrapping records for its customer
         zones.

      -  deSEC performs bootstrapping record synthesis for its zones
         using names _signal.ns1.desec.io and _signal.ns2.desec.org.

   *  Authoritative nameserver support:

      -  Knot DNS supports signaling record synthesis since version
         3.3.5.

      -  An implementation of bootstrapping record synthesis in PowerDNS
         is available at https://github.com/desec-io/desec-ns/pull/46
         (https://github.com/desec-io/desec-ns/pull/46).

8.2.  Parental Agent-side

   *  ccTLD:

      -  SWITCH (.ch, .li) has implemented authentication of consumed
         CDS records based on this draft.

      -  .cl is working on an implementation.

   *  gTLD:

      -  Knipp has implemented consumption of DNSSEC bootstrapping
         records in its TANGO and CORE registry systems.

      -  A deployment of this is running at .swiss.

   *  Registrars:

      -  Glauca has implemented authenticated CDS processing.

      -  GoDaddy is working on an implementation.

   *  A tool to retrieve and process signaling records for bootstrapping
      purposes, either directly or via zone walking, is available at
      https://github.com/desec-io/dsbootstrap (https://github.com/desec-
      io/dsbootstrap).  The tool outputs the validated DS records which
      then can be added to the parent zone.

   |  Turn loose Security Considerations points into coherent text.
   |  
   |  Do no longer suggest NSEC-walking Signaling Domains.  (It does not
   |  work well due to the Signaling Type prefix.  What's more, it's
   |  unclear who would do this: Parents know there delegations and can
   |  do a targeted scan; others are not interested.)

   |  Editorial changes.
